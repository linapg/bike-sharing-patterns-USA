### Project Title
The US bike-share data explorer

### Description
This project explores the Motivate database for a bike share system for many major cities in the United States. It aims to uncover bike share usage patterns by comparing the information of three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Motivation
The US bike-sharing data-explorer was created to fulfil the requirements of the Udacity® Nano-degree Program: 'Programming for Data Science with Python’.

### Features
The program is interactive and works by filtering the data frames of each one of the cities with time filters. The program calculates descriptive statistics for stations, trips, and users. It offers the possibility to get information on gender, and birth year. It also shows the average trip and average age grouped by gender (only for the cities of Chicago and New York). The user can explore individual data as well.
